should i make the program load any number of file ?


good practice to apply : 
- use size_t type for variables dedicated to access a index of an array/vector
- should i use uint for go trough a vector 


don't mention the destrctor in the .cpp cause linking errors !


Prototyping:
DONE -read files and load the frames into the processes 
DONE- run round robin without frame conditions
- load all frames at the beginning
	add the condition if the frame is loaded
	don't implement the loading of frames yet
	-> should have the same output as previous prototype
Problems:
	-why the process 4 has m_next_frame = 7 at the end of the program?
	DONE -all processes issue a fault time at the end


- add the condition if the frame is loaded in memory run the process otherwise stay idle


- run RR with dynamic frame loading
