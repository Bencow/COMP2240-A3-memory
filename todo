should i make the program load any number of file ?


good practice to apply : 
- use size_t type for variables dedicated to access a index of an array/vector
- should i use uint for go trough a vector 


don't mention the destrctor in the .cpp cause linking errors !


Prototyping:
DONE -read files and load the frames into the processes 
- load all the frames for each process and run round robin
- run RR with dynamic rame loading
